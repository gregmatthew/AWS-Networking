ðŸ§ª Lab: Networking Resources for a VPC (AWS)
Lab Title: Creating Networking Resources in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Duration: ~60 minutes
Role: Cloud Support Engineer (AWS)

ðŸ§­ Lab Objectives
- Summarize and assess the customer scenario
- Create a VPC with associated networking components:
- Internet Gateway (IGW)
- Route Table
- Security Group
- Network Access Control List (NACL)
- EC2 instance
- Confirm successful internet connectivity from the instance using ping

ðŸ“Œ Scenario
"Hello Cloud Support!
I previously reached out to you regarding help setting up my VPC... All I need to do is ping! Can you please help me set up my VPC to where it has network connectivity and can ping? The architecture is below. Thanks!"
â€” Brock, Startup Owner


ðŸ”§ Key Configuration
VPC & Subnet
- VPC Name: Test VPC
- CIDR: 192.168.0.0/18
- Public Subnet: 192.168.1.0/26
Internet Access
- Created and attached Internet Gateway
- Configured Route Table with:
- Local route: 192.168.0.0/18 â†’ local
- IGW route: 0.0.0.0/0 â†’ IGW
- Associated the route table with Public Subnet
Security
- Network ACLs allowing all inbound/outbound traffic for the subnet
- Security Group attached to the EC2 instance, allowing:
- SSH (TCP 22)
- HTTP (TCP 80)
- HTTPS (TCP 443)
- Outbound: All traffic to 0.0.0.0/0
EC2 Instance
- AMI: Amazon Linux 2023
- Type: t3.micro
- Subnet: Public Subnet
- Auto-assign Public IP: Enabled
- Security Group: Public Access SG
- Verified connectivity using:
ping google.com



âœ… Outcome
The instance successfully pinged external addressesâ€”validating correct setup of the VPC's networking components. Mission accomplished!

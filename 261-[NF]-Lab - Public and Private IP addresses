AWS Lab: Public and Private IP Addresses
Overview
This lab focuses on understanding and troubleshooting public and private IP addresses within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The lab simulates a real-world scenario where a cloud support engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) assists a customer with a networking issue.
Objectives
Summarize and investigate a customer scenario involving AWS networking.
Analyze the differences between public and private IP addresses.
Develop a solution to the customer's networking issue.
Summarize and describe findings (group activity).
Duration
Approximately 1 hour.
Scenario
You are a cloud support engineer at AWS. A customer from a Fortune 500 company reports a networking issue within their AWS infrastructure. They have one VPC with a CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/16, containing two Amazon EC2 instances (Instance A and Instance B) in the same subnet with identical configurations. However:
Instance A cannot reach the internet.
Instance B can reach the internet.
The customer suspects an issue with the EC2 instance configurations and also inquires about using a public IP address range (e.g., 12.0.0.0/16) for a new VPC, asking if this would cause issues. The provided architecture includes a VPC, an internet gateway, and a public subnet hosting both instances.
AWS Architecture
VPC: CIDR range 10.0.0.0/16
Components: Internet Gateway, Public Subnet with Instance A and Instance B.
Note: The lab assumes the AWS architecture (route tables, internet gateway, subnets) is correctly configured, as one instance can access the internet.
Tasks
Task 1: Investigate the Customer's Environment
Access the AWS Management Console.
Choose Start Lab to launch the lab environment.
Wait for the Lab status: ready message, then close the Start Lab panel.
Open the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab.
Navigate to the EC2 dashboard:
Search for EC2 in the AWS Console or find it under Services > Compute.
Select Instances from the left navigation menu to view the two EC2 instances.
Record instance details:
Select Instance A, go to the Networking tab, and note its Public and Private IPv4 addresses.
Repeat for Instance B.
Compare the IP addresses and note any differences (e.g., presence or absence of a public IP address for Instance A).
Key Consideration:
Private IP Addresses: Typically within ranges like 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16, used for internal communication within a VPC.
Public IP Addresses: Routable on the internet, assigned dynamically or via Elastic IPs, required for internet access.
Troubleshooting Insight: Instance A likely lacks a public IP address or proper routing, preventing internet access, while Instance B has a public IP and correct configuration.
Task 2: Use SSH to Connect to an Amazon Linux EC2 Instance
For Windows Users:
From the lab instructions, select Details > Show to view credentials.
Download the labsuser.ppk file (saved to the Downloads directory).
Note the Public IP address of the instance.
Download and install PuTTY if not already installed.
Configure a PuTTY session to connect to the EC2 instance (refer to AWS documentation: Connect to your Linux instance using PuTTY).
For macOS/Linux Users:
Use an SSH utility to connect to the instance using the provided credentials and public IP address.
Verify connectivity to the instance and test internet access (e.g., using ping or curl commands).
Key Consideration:
This task helps confirm whether the instance's networking configuration (e.g., security groups, network ACLs, or public IP assignment) is causing the issue.
Task 3: Respond to the Customer (Group Activity)
In groups of two:
Person 1 (Cloud Support Engineer): Summarize findings and explain why Instance A cannot reach the internet (e.g., missing public IP or incorrect security group settings) and why Instance B can.
Person 2 (Jess, the customer): Review the explanation and ask clarifying questions.
Address the customer’s question about using a public IP range (e.g., 12.0.0.0/16) for a new VPC:
Response: Using a public IP range for a VPC is not recommended. Public IP ranges are routable on the internet and owned by organizations or assigned by ISPs. Using them in a VPC can cause routing conflicts or connectivity issues, as AWS cannot control public IP ranges. Instead, use private IP ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) for VPCs to ensure proper isolation and routing.
If a group activity is not feasible, one student should present findings to the class.

Findings
Issue with Instance A: Likely lacks a public IP address or has restrictive security group/network ACL settings, preventing internet access. Instance B has a public IP and proper configuration, allowing internet connectivity.
Public vs. Private IP:
Private IPs are used within the VPC for internal communication and are not routable on the internet.
Public IPs are required for internet access and are typically assigned dynamically or as Elastic IPs.
Customer’s Public IP Range Question: Using a public IP range like 12.0.0.0/16 for a VPC is incorrect and could lead to routing conflicts. AWS VPCs should use private IP ranges to ensure proper network isolation and functionality.
Lab Completion
End the lab by selecting End Lab and confirming with Yes.
Close the confirmation panel.

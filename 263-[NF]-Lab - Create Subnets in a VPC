# AWS Lab: Create Subnets in a VPC

## Lab Overview
This lab focuses on creating subnets and allocating IP addresses within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The goal was to assist a customer in setting up a VPC with approximately 15,000 private IP addresses and a public subnet with at least 50 IP addresses.

---

## Objectives
- Summarize the customer scenario.
- Create an Amazon VPC with subnets and allocate IP addresses.
- Familiarize with the AWS Management Console.
- Develop a solution for the customer's networking issue.

## Customer Scenario
A startup company requested assistance in setting up their first VPC on AWS. The customer needed:
- A VPC with around 15,000 private IP addresses.
- The VPC's IPv4 CIDR block to use a `192.x.x.x` range.
- A public subnet with at least 50 IP addresses.

---

## Tasks Performed

### Task 1: Investigate the Customerâ€™s Needs
1. **Understanding VPC Basics**:
   - A VPC is a logically isolated virtual network in AWS.
   - Resources within a VPC communicate via private IP addresses.
   - Public subnets allow internet access, while private subnets require a NAT gateway for internet connectivity.

2. **CIDR Block Selection**:
   - Used RFC 1918 to determine private IP ranges.
   - Calculated the CIDR block using a subnet calculator to accommodate 15,000 IP addresses.
   - Chose `192.168.0.0/18` for the VPC (providing 16,379 IP addresses).
   - Allocated `192.168.1.0/26` for the public subnet (providing 59 IP addresses).

3. **VPC Creation**:
   - Launched the VPC Wizard in the AWS Management Console.
   - Selected **VPC with a Single Public Subnet**.
   - Configured the VPC with the chosen CIDR blocks and named it "First VPC".
   - Verified the VPC creation under **Your VPCs**.

### Task 2: Group Activity (Simulated Customer Interaction)
- Collaborated with a peer to simulate the customer (Brock) and cloud support engineer roles.
- Walked through the VPC creation process, explaining each step to the "customer".

Below is an example of the completed VPC configuration:

| Parameter               | Value               |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| IPv4 CIDR Block         | `192.168.0.0/18`    |
| VPC Name                | `First VPC`         |
| Public Subnet CIDR      | `192.168.1.0/26`    |
| Availability Zone       | No Preference       |
| Subnet Name             | `Public subnet`     |

## Key Learnings
- How to design a VPC with appropriate CIDR blocks to meet IP address requirements.
- The difference between public and private subnets and their use cases.
- Hands-on experience with the AWS Management Console and VPC Wizard.

---

## Conclusion
This lab provided practical experience in creating and configuring a VPC on AWS. By addressing the customer's requirements, I gained a deeper understanding of subnetting, CIDR notation, and VPC architecture.

**Lab Status**: Completed successfully.  
**Time Taken**: Approximately 1 hour.
